# Blog Tutorials

This project is used to show complete source code for use on my personal blog. Work on this will be delayed 
until [my website](https://github.com/MsStryker/morgynstryker.com) development process has been documentated 
and served on AWS again.

The current structure of this project is not a complete Python application and primarily scratch at this point.

Tutorials have been previously described on my website https://morgynstryker.com.
